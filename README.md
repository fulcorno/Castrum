# Castrum
"Sancti Georgii Castrum", an (unfinished) MS-DOS adventure game inside the Casle of San Giorgio Canavese 

This repository contains the unfinished work about a graphical adventure game that I was developing in the 1998-2001 time frame.
It has been designed jointly with Stefano Roletti, and we had the goal of increasing the knowledge about our village's castle (at that time, it was abandoned and could not be visited, except by trespassing).

The code was written in Turbo C, and I don't expect it to run on modern computers anymore. The graphics was tailored to CGA boards or to the Olivetti M4 (aka ATT6300) graphic card.
The project is unfinished and abandoned, might have some historical interest.

The code is donated to the Public Domain.
